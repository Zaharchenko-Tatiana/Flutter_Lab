During the work, all the screen components that were specified in the task were implemented:

And added buttons in the form of icons in the AppBar, arrows in the “Tariffs and Limits” section, as well as in the “Interests” section.

Colors are placed in a separate class so that they can be called.
It was quite difficult to deal with the syntax to make everything watchable.

Some details are missing from the work, such as section buttons.
Thanks for checking!
